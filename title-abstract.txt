Title:
Predicting of Handedness with Resting-State fMRI Data

Abstract:
Handedness is a key aspect of human lateralization and has been linked to
distinct neural connectivity patterns in the brain. In this study, we aimed to
classify handedness using functional connectivity features derived from the
Human Connectome Project (HCP) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging

(fMRI) data with the help of machine learning tools. We used Pearsonâ€™s cor-
relations to investigate the connectivity through correlations between fMRI

signals and as one of our inputs for our models. We implemented multi-
ple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM),

Logistic Regression, Polynomial Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent Re-
gressor and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and predict

handedness based on brain connectivity. Given the strong class imbalance

and small datasets, with right-handed participants significantly outnumber-
ing left-handed ones, we experimented undersampling and oversampling,

and we are currently working on stablizing the model performances to a spe-
cific range.
